  The Crowds protocol was developed by Reiter and Rubin [RR98] to provide users with a mechanism for anonymous Web browsing. 

  The main idea behind Crowds and similar approaches to anonymity is to hide each user's communications by routing them randomly 
within a group of similar users. Even if a local eavesdropper or a corrupt group member observes a message being sent by a 
particular user, it can never be sure whether the user is the actual sender, or is simply routing another user's message.
